> He lay flat on the brown, pine-needled floor of the forest, his chin on his
> folded arms, and high overhead the wind blew in the tops of the pine trees.
> The mountainside sloped gently where he lay; but below it was steep and he
> could see the dark of the oiled road winding through the pass. There was a
> stream alongside the road and far down the pass he saw a mill beside the
> stream and the falling water of the dam, white in the summer sunlight.
